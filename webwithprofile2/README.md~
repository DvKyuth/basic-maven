# Building For Different Environments with Maven 3

The webapp project structure
```java
pom.xml
src/
  main/
    java/
    resources/
  test/
    java/
```

Under src/main/resources there are three files:
```java
    application.properties - This is the default configuration and will be packaged in the artifact by default.
    ENV.test.properties - This is the variant for the test environment.
    ENV.prod.properties - This is basically the same as the test variant and will be used in the production environment.

    In the project descriptor, you need to configure the different profiles. Only the test profile is showed here.
```
